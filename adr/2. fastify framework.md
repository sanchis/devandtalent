### Accepted

## Context
We need a node framework to develop the logic for the organic team.
The needs for organic team.
- Fast.
- Error handling.
- Schema validation

## Decision
I see a lot of frameworks ad benchmarks comparation abaout performance.

### Features
- **Highly performant:** as far as we know, Fastify is one of the fastest web frameworks in town, depending on the code complexity we can serve up to 76+ thousand requests per second.
- **Extendible:** Fastify is fully extensible via its hooks, plugins and decorators.
- **Schema based:** even if it is not mandatory we recommend to use [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) to validate your routes and serialize your outputs, internally Fastify compiles the schema in a highly performant function.
- **Logging:** logs are extremely important but are costly; we chose the best logger to almost remove this cost, [Pino](https://github.com/pinojs/pino)!
- **Developer friendly:** the framework is built to be very expressive and help the developer in their daily use, without sacrificing performance and security.

Benchmarks taken using https://github.com/fastify/benchmarks. This is a
synthetic, "hello world" benchmark that aims to evaluate the framework
overhead. The overhead that each framework has on your application
depends on your application, you should __always__ benchmark if performance
matters to you.

## Consequences

I think it would be the best choice for the project. However, we are tying ourselves to a technology that is not always good.
